If they aren't installed on your computer, you can follow the installation instructions on [rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Cargo should be installed when you installed rust. Howerver, you can compiled it from source by following the instructions on [cargo documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/ecyht2/print-big-text-rs
cd print-big-text-rs
cargo build --release
```

The compiled executable would be located in `target/release/print-big-text-rs`
